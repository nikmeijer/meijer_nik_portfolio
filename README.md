## Nik Meijer Portfolio

My portfolio branding is done in a swiss design inspired style to keep simplicity. I used lots of negative space and sorted content into big blocks for an easy to follow, simple, effective structure. This is a design portfolio so when people see it I want them to see something new. Something I can bring to the table.

## The Concept

Simple, clean cut, blocky style, swiss inspired design.

Bright bold colours and muted equivalents, flowy gradients, and contrast+compliment

## Note from the Creator

My designs aren't perfect yet but everyday I'll strive to get closer
